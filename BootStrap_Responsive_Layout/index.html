				Twitter Bootstrap is a front end framework to develop web apps and sites fast. 
				In modern web development, there are several components which are required in almost all web projects. <br>
				Bootstrap provides you with all those basic modules - Grid, Typography, Tables, Forms, Buttons and Responsiveness. <br>
				Besides, there are plethora of other useful front end components like Dropdowns, Navigation, Modals, Typehead, Pagination, Carousal, Breadcrumb, Tab, Thumbnails, Headers etc. 
				With these you can make a web project up and running quickly and easily.<br>
				Bootstrap has a few easy ways to quickly get started, each one appealing to a different skill level and use case. Read through to see what suits your particular needs.
				<br>
				Bootstrap is downloadable in two forms, within which you'll find the following directories and files, logically grouping common resources and providing both compiled and minified variations.<br>
				With Bootstrap, the first thing you do is cash in on a lot of time. The Bootstrap libraries offer readymade pieces of code that can pump life into a website. A web developer doesnt have to spend time laboriously working out and writing code, but simply find the right piece and fit it into the structure they are working on.
				 In addition to this, a lot of the styling and design aspects are already taken care of, since the CSS is built with LESS.<br>
				 A great aspect of Bootstrap is that you can make it your own. You can sit down and rummage through the whole framework and keep what you need and ditch what you dont. The whole point of Bootstrap is that it lets you factor in your own needs and tailor your development project accordingly. 
				This is the main reason many developers feel some tools are completely useless on the Bootstrap while others revere the same.<br>
				One of the main reasons this toolset was developed was because Twitter was seeing big inconsistencies between developers working on their projects. This caused some issues both on the development front and the end-user front. Since it works with a central set of development code, 
				Bootstrap’s results are uniform across platforms. You’ll see the same thing on Internet Explorer, Chrome and Firefox.
				<br>
				If you are working on a site which is already live, but still trying to iron out the creases then Bootstrap can help. For instance, if you use table styling, all you need to do is take the styles you need and copy them to the CSS file you are working with. Bootstrap will immediately kick in with its own style and all you need to do from there is link up the file you are working with or hotlink to Twitter (more or less).
			                Integration is simple, fast and easy to accomplish and once you are done you can play with your design to your hearts content.<br>
				Bootstrap is responsive. If you shift from a laptop to an iPad and from an iPad to a Mac you wont have to fret over your work. Bootstrap adapts to the change in platforms with super speed and efficiency.
